This small utility sets the Logitech(R) Unifying Receiver into the "pairing
mode", that means it will look for new wireless Logitech(R) input devices to
remember them next time they are switched on. A receiver can manage up to six
devices - but a device can only be assigned to a single receiver. Using this
feature saves rare USB ports.
There is no need to "unpair" a device - in case you want to use an other
receiver, just pair the device with it.


1. QUICK INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

unipair will automatically search the receiver and ask you to connect a
device. After connecting, it will wait for the new USB device to appear in your
system:

sudo ./unipair
Searching for the Logitech Receiver...
Found USB Receiver: /dev/hidraw1
Switch your device OFF and press ENTER to continue.

Waiting -  switch your device ON or press CTRL+C to exit.
.......
Detected new device
Node: /dev/hidraw4
Subsystem: hidraw

After succesfull pairing your device is ready for use.

In case you know which hidraw device is assigned to your receiver, you can
define it as parameter. But normally you should rely on the search feature.

Other options: --help, --version


2. TESTED DEVICES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These devices were tested by myself:
-Mouse M510
-Keyboard K400r
-Trackball M570

You may send me reports of other Unifying devices to complete this list.


3. ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you want to reassign devices to an other receiver, unplug the old receiver.
This may seem a silly advice but pairing is not possible when the old receiver is
still available.
The receiver will not wait forever after it is set to pairing mode - in case your
device is not accepted please try again (and hurry up  switching it ON).

The magic command to enable the pairing mode was published by a former Logitech 
employee after asking the company for permission. It was not reengineered.

It should be trivial for Logitech to publish a Linux pairing utility - possibly
they don't want to invest into a GUI tool which has to be maintained for several
distributions.
