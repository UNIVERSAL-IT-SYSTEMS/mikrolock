<h1>MikroLock manual</h1>
<p>
MikroLock reads and writes encrypted miniLock files.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
MikroLock is a fast native implementation of the minilock file format.
Despite its name (and in contrast to the original Chrome extension), it can also handle BIG files.
</p>

<p>
The main goal of development is to provide an easy exchange of encrypted data
using mail or cloud services. MikroLock is based on modern public key encryption
without configuration or learning efforts.
The miniLock file format is also understood by the Chrome browser extension of the same name, this might help if corporate rules do not
allow an installation of MikroLock.
</p>

<p>
A short description of minilock's benefits (source: <a href="https://minilock.io">https://minilock.io</a>):
<br>
<i>&quot;
Enter your miniLock passphrase on any computer, and you'll get access to your
miniLock ID. No key storage or management - just a single passphrase to access
your miniLock identity anywhere.
&quot;</i>

<p>
A minilock ID is a short public key derived from a secret passphrase and an
E-mail address. This ID may be published on websites, mail signatures, twitter
etc. to enable anyone to encrypt data for this ID. Only the receiver who
applies the correct mail and passphrase to derive this ID can decrypt the content.
</p>

<p>
A minilock ID looks like this: <code>jrcY8VJWKihbiLsDnaMaNSoL2fZSTiRmEeJcKGBYxnb83</code>
</p>

<p>
Since the minilock IDs are very comfortable to handle, there is no need for a
cumbersome key exchange process like using keyservers or manually copying key
files to hosts.
</p>

<p>
A sender can define a list of minilock IDs to let multiple recipients decrypt 
the file.
A minilock file does not contain any visible information about its recipients.
</p>



<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
A wants to encrypt a file for B. B enters his mail address and passphrase into MikroLock to obtain his miniLock ID. He sends this ID to A.<br>
A encrypts the file and adds B's miniLock ID as recipient ID. A now sends the encrypted file to B, who is able to decrypt it using his passphrase/mail combination.<br>
It is important to keep the passphrase secret - only the miniLock IDs (=public keys) are being exchanged.
</p>



<h2>The graphical interface</h2>

<p>
After the program starts it asks for your mail adress and passphrase.
With this information a key pair is generated (private and public key).<br>
You do not need to enter a valid mail address unless you want to use the miniLock Chrome extension.<br>
To achieve a secure encryption, a passphrase less than 40 characters needs to consist of several random words.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to enter Unicode characters:</p>

<br><br>

<p>

The <b>mail icon</b> shows whether the mail adress is valid:

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>
<img src=":/Status-mail-unread-icon.png"  border="0" alt="Icon 1" width="32">
</td><td style="vertical-align:middle">
the mail address appears to be valid
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>
<img src=":/Status-mail-unread-new-icon.png"  border="0" alt="Icon 1" width="32">
</td><td style="vertical-align:middle">
the mail address appears to be invalid
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br><br>
The <b>signal icon</b> gives you following information::

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>
<img src=":/Status-security-low-icon.png"  border="0" alt="Icon 1" width="32">
</td><td style="vertical-align:middle">
the passphrase is too short (minimum length: 20 characters)
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>
<img src=":/Status-security-medium-icon.png"  border="0" alt="Icon 1" width="32">
</td><td style="vertical-align:middle">
the passphrase needs to consist of at least five words. It might be refused by the original MiniLock-Plugin for Chrome
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>
<img src=":/Status-security-high-icon.png"  border="0" alt="Icon 1" width="32">
</td><td style="vertical-align:middle">
the passphrase offers sufficient security
</td>
</tr>
</table>

After clicking &quot;Generate my miniLock ID&quot; your ID will be shown at the window bottom. You are able to copy it nearby.<br><br>
Now the input/output dialog is displayed:
</p>

<br><br>
<img src=":/manual/manual3.png"  border="0" alt="MikroLock GUI 1">

<p>
Here you choose the destination directory and the file to encrypt or decrypt (if the program was called with a file as argument, its path is shown in the statusbar).<br>
You may also drag and drop a file onto the window.<br>
If a minilock file was selected, it will be automatically decrypted. Any other file will be encrypted in the next screen:
</p>

<p>
Using the upper list you define the miniLock IDs of your file recipients.<br>
Press &quot;Read list file&quot; to import a text file which contains one miniLock ID per line. The recipient's names may be entered behind their IDs as follows:
<pre>
y5qBLmncv36r98tFMw5YVoc9SHkfLDg8Wz7zf9yrPYPh2 / Andre Simon
8SmHNEEZiK1RgWoN9xryJb8opBky9Kh7txhmgb1RLrUrW ; Customer XYZ
sVXHR7smwqXkSbphn8gdH3Ah6a1nvbYtuXPpxG6qKT321 - Schmidt
ULgpTbP7isNNV6kgDbNVtQo5YRuUhc4N5AAEEbne9bjJi | Jane
</pre>
The information behind the separators will be displayed as tooltips.
<br><br>
The button &quot;Clear recipients&quot; will delete the ID entries.<br>
The option &quot;Omit my ID&quot; removes your own miniLock-ID from the recipients, preventing you from opening the encrypted file.<br>
Applying &quot;Generate a random output filename&quot; will save the encrypted file using a randomized name.<br><br>
After clicking &quot;Encrypt the file&quot; the minilock file will be stored in the previously defined destination directory.
</p>


<h2>The command line interface</h2>
<p>Apart from the graphical user interface, MikroLock also offers a command line executable.</p>
<pre>
USAGE: mikrolock [OPTION]...
mikrolock reads and writes encrypted miniLock files (https://minilock.io/)

Available options:

  -E, --encrypt &lt;file&gt;  Encrypt the given file (see -r)
  -D, --decrypt &lt;file&gt;  Decrypt the given miniLock file
  -o, --output &lt;file&gt;   Override the target file name (assumes -D or -E)
  -m, --mail &lt;string&gt;   User mail address (salt)
  -r, --rcpt &lt;string&gt;   Recipient's miniLock ID (may be repeated, assumes -E)

  -h, --help            Print this help screen
  -l, --list &lt;file&gt;     Recipient list text file (contains one miniLock ID per line)
                        ID descriptions may be added using these delimiters: space or one of [,;/|-]
  -p, --pinentry        Use pinentry program to ask for the passphrase
  -q, --quiet           Do not print progress information
  -R, --random-name     Generate random output filename; write to current working directory (assumes -E)
  -v, --version         Print version information
  -x, --exclude-me      Exlude own miniLock ID from recipient list (assumes -E)

If neither -E nor -D is given, mikrolock exits after showing your miniLock ID.
</pre>

<h2>Compatibility with the miniLock browser extension</h2>
<p>
The miniLock file format was established by the miniLock Chrome browser extension.<br>
While the produced files are interchangeable with each program, the accepted input to obtain a miniLock ID differs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>miniLock accepts only valid mail addresses as salt; MikroLock accepts any value</li>
<li>miniLock applies a passphrase entropy check; MikroLock may accept passphrases with lower entropy</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are going to use MikroLock and miniLock in parallel, choose a salt and passphrase which is accepted in both applications.
</p>

<h2>Applied crypto functions</h2>
<p>
A miniLock-ID is defined as:</p>
<pre>secret := <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/password_hashing/README.html#key-derivation" target="new">scrypt</a>(<a href="https://blake2.net" target="new">blake2</a>(passphrase), mail, 131072, 1)
id := <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58" target="new">base58</a>( <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/advanced/scalar_multiplication.html" target="new">crypto_scalarmult_base</a>(secret) + <a href="https://blake2.net" target="new">blake2</a>(secret) )
</pre>
<p>
The JSON header of a miniLock file contains the sender's miniLock ID, the recipient's IDs, file hash and the random key of the encrypted input file.<br><br>
This information is encrypted separately with each given recipient ID as public key using <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html" target="new">crypto_box_easy</a> (key exchange: Curve25519; encryption: XSalsa20 stream cipher; authentication: Poly1305 MAC).<br><br>
The input file is encrypted using <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html" target="new">crypto_secretbox_easy</a> (encryption: XSalsa20 stream cipher; authentication: Poly1305 MAC).<br><br>
