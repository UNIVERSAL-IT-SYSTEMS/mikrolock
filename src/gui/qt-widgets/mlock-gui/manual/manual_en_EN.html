<h1>mlock manual</h1>
<p>
mlock reads and writes encrypted miniLock files.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
mlock is a fast native implementation of the minilock file format.
Despite its name (and in contrast to the original implementation), it can also 
handle BIG files.
</p>
<p>

A short description of minilock's benefits (source: <a href="https://minilock.io">https://minilock.io</a>):
<br>
<i>&quot;
Enter your miniLock passphrase on any computer, and you'll get access to your
miniLock ID. No key storage or management â€” just a single passphrase to access
your miniLock identity anywhere. miniLock uses modern cryptographic primitives
to accomplish this securely.
&quot;</i>

<p>
A minilock ID is a short public key derived from a secret passphrase and an
E-mail address. This ID may be published on websites, mail signatures, twitter
etc. to enable anyone to encrypt data for this ID. Only the receiver who
applies the correct mail and passphrase to derive this ID can decrypt the content.
</p>

<p>
A minilock ID looks like this: <code>jrcY8VJWKihbiLsDnaMaNSoL2fZSTiRmEeJcKGBYxnb83</code>
</p>

<p>
Since the minilock IDs are very comfortable to handle, there is no need for a
cumbersome key exchange process like using keyservers or manually copying key
files to hosts.
</p>

<p>
A sender can define a list of minilock IDs to let multiple recipients decrypt 
the file.
A minilock file does not contain any visible information about its recipients.
</p>



<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
A wants to encrypt a file for B. B enters his mail address and passphrase into mlock to obtain his miniLock ID. He sends this ID to A.<br>
A encrypts the file and adds B's miniLock ID as recipient ID. A now sends the encrypted file to B, who is able to decrypt it using his passphrase/mail combination.<br>
It is important to keep the passphrase secret - only the miniLock IDs (=public keys) are being exchanged.
</p>



<h2>The graphical interface</h2>

<p>
After the program starts it asks for your mail adress and passphrase.
With this information a key pair is generated (private and public key).
To achieve a secure encryption, the passphrase needs to consist of several random words.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to enter Unicode characters:</p>

<br><br>

<p>
The signal icon gives you following information:

<ul>
<li>red: the passphrase is too short or contains not enough space characters</li>
<li>yellow: the passphrase will most likely be refused by the original MiniLock-Plugin for Chrome</li>
<li>green: the passphrase offers sufficient security</li>
</ul>

After clicking &quot;Generate my miniLock ID&quot; your ID will be shown near the window bottom. You are able to copy it nearby.<br><br>
Now the input/output dialog is displayed:
</p>

<br><br>

<p>
Here you choose the destination directory and the file to encrypt or decrypt (if the program was called with a file as argument, its path is shown in the statusbar).<br>
You may also drag and drop a file onto the window.<br>
If a minilock file was selected, it will be automatically decrypted. Any other file will be encrypted in the next screen:
</p>

<br><br>

<p>
Using the upper list you can define up to 50 miniLock IDs of your file recipients.<br>
After clicking &quot;Encrypt the file&quot; the minilock file will be stored in the previously defined destination directory.
</p>


<h2>The command line interface</h2>
<p>Apart from the graphical user interface, mlock also offers a command line executable.</p>
<pre>
USAGE: mlock [OPTION]...
mlock reads and writes encrypted miniLock files (https://minilock.io/)

Available options:

  -E, --encrypt &lt;file&gt;  Encrypt the given file (see -r)
  -D, --decrypt &lt;file&gt;  Decrypt the given miniLock file
  -o, --output &lt;file&gt;   Override the target file name (assumes -D or -E)
  -m, --mail &lt;string&gt;   User mail address (salt)
  -r, --rcpt &lt;string&gt;   Recipient's miniLock ID (may be repeated up to 50x, assumes -E)
  -x, --exclude-me      Exlude own miniLock ID from recipient list (assumes -E)
  -p, --pinentry        Use pinentry for passphrase input
  -q, --quiet           Do not print progress information
  -h, --help            Print this help screen
  -v, --version         Print version information

If neither -E nor -D is given, mlock exits after showing your miniLock ID.

Task completed.
</pre>

<p>
The encrypted file is libsodium-1.0.0.tar.gz.minilock<br>
This file can be decrypted by the receiver EX9k9VmGzjg7mUBFN9mzc7nkcvhmD6fGZTq3nefEajjxX
</p>

<h3>File decryption</h3>

<pre>

<h2>Applied crypto functions</h2>
<p>
The Minilock-ID is defined as:</p>
<pre>secret := <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/password_hashing/README.html#key-derivation" target="new">scrypt</a>(<a href="https://blake2.net" target="new">blake2</a>(passphrase), mail, 131072, 1)
id := <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58" target="new">base58</a>( <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/advanced/scalar_multiplication.html" target="new">crypto_scalarmult_base</a>(secret) + <a href="https://blake2.net" target="new">blake2</a>(secret) )
</pre>
<p>
The JSON header of a miniLock file contains the sender's miniLock ID, the recipient's IDs, file hash and key of the encrypted input file.<br>
This information is encrypted separately with each given recipient ID as public key using <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html" target="new">crypto_box_easy</a>.<br>
The input file is encrypted with <a href="http://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html" target="new">crypto_secretbox_easy</a><br><br>
